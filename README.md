## Description

_Pig Dice is a dice game where two players can face off against each other.  Each player takes turns rolling the dice trying to accumulate the most points each turn with the end goal of reaching 100 points first.  When you roll a 1 you lose that rounds points and it is the other player's turn.  If you don't roll a 1 you can hold to stop rolling and keep your points for that round or you can roll again and risk rolling a 1 and loosing your turn._
